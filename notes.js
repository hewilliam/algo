// run time complexity

// 1. constant time ** 1
//     1. no matter how many elements were working with, the algorithm/operation will always take the same time.
// 2. Log time ** log(n)
//     1. you have this if doubling the number of element you are iterating over does NOT doubt the amount of work
//         1. SEARCHING a sorted array
// 3. linear time ** n
//     1. iterating thru all elements in a collection of data. if you see a for loop from ‘0 to array.length’, you probably have linear time
// 4. quasilinear **  n log (n)
//         1. you have this if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesn’t double the work
//             1. assume sorting operations are nlog(n)
// 5. quad time ** n^2
//     1. every element in a collection has to be compared to every other element
//         1. handshake problem
// 6. exponential 2^n
//     1. if you had a single element in collection, the processing power required doubles
